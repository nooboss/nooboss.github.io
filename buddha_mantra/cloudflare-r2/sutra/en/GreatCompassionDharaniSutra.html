Thus I have heard, once Sakyamuni Buddha was at Potalaka Mountain, in the treasure-adorned Way-place in Avalokitesvara's palace, sitting on a precious Lion-Throne adorned in purity with countless multifarious Mani-jewels. Hundreds of precious streamers and banners were hanging all around.<br><br>At that time, the Tathagata, who was sitting on his throne, intending to explain a teaching of the Total-Retention Dharani, was along with innumerable Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas, whose names are: Dharani King Bodhisattva, Treasure King Bodhisattva, Bhaisajya-Raja(Medicine King) Bodhisattva, Bhaisajya-Samudgata(Medicine Superior) Bodhisattva, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, Maha-stamaprapta(Great Strength) Bodhisattva, Avatamsaka Bodhisattva, Great Sublime Bodhisattva, Precious Deposits Bodhisattva, Virtue Store Bodhisattva, Vajragarbha Bodhisattva, Akasagarbha(Space Store) Bodhisattva, Maitreya Bodhisattva, Samantabhadra(Universal Goodness) Bodhisattva, Manjusri Bodhisattva, and so on. Such Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas are all great Dharma-Princes who had been empowered through their crowns (Abhiseka).<br><br>The Buddha was also along with innumerable great Voice-Hearers (Sravakas), all of whom were practicing the tenth stage of Arhat, headed by Maha-Kasyapa;<br><br>He was also along with innumerable gods of Brahma-Heaven, headed by Sinza-Brahma;<br><br>Also along with Him were innumerable Gods of heavens of the desire realm, headed by Gopaka-God;<br><br>Also along with Him were innumerable four-guardian-gods, headed by Dhritarastra;<br><br>Also along with Him were innumerable gods, dragons, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Asuras, Garudas, Kinnaras, Mahoragas, human beings, Amanusyas, headed by Heavenly Virtue great dragon king;<br><br>Also along with Him were innumerable goddesses of heavens of the desire realm, headed by Virginal Eye goddesses;<br><br>Also along with Him were innumerable Sunyatas(Gods of spaces), gods of rivers and oceans, gods of fountains and spring, gods of stream and pond, gods of herb, gods of forest, gods of houses, gods of water, gods of fire, gods of earth, gods of wind, gods of ground, gods of mountains, gods of rocks, gods of palaces, and so on.<br><br>They all came and gathered in the congregation.<br><br>At that time in the congregation, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva secretly emitted his sacrosanct light, thereupon, the worlds in the ten directions, along with this three-thousand-great-thousand worlds system, were all illuminated and became golden. Heavenly palaces, palaces of dragons, and palaces of all gods were all shaken. Rivers, oceans, Iron-Ring Mountains (Cakravada-parvata), Sumeru Mountains, Earth Mountains, and black mountains were also shaken. The light of suns, moons, pearls, fire, and constellations all disappeared.<br><br>Witnessing this rare scene, Dharani King Bodhisattva was more surprised than ever before, so he arose from his seat, joined his palms and asked the Buddha with a Gatha(verse):<br><br>"Who achieved the Correct-Awakening today, emitting such great bright light universally?<br><br>The worlds of the ten directions are all golden, so do these three-thousand-great-thousand worlds.<br><br>Who attained the ultimate freedom today, manifesting the rare great holy power?<br><br>Innumerable Buddha-Worlds are shaken, so do palaces of dragons and gods.<br><br>Now the entire congregation is wondering, not knowing whose power caused these.<br><br>Is he a Buddha, Bodhisattva, or great Voice-Hearer, or a Brahman, demon, heavenly god, or Sakra?<br><br>We pray for the Bhagavan (World Honored One)'s Great Compassion, to tell us the source of this great supernatural power."<br><br>The Buddha told Dharani King Bodhisattva: "Virtuous man, you all should know that in this congregation there is a Bodhisattva-Mahasattva named Avalokitesvara, the Unrestricted One. He had achieved the Great Kindness and Great Compassion since uncountable Kalpas before, and he excels at practicing countless Dharani-Gates. In order to comfort and please all living-beings, he secretly emits such great sacrosanct power.<br><br>After the Buddha said that, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva arose from his seat, tidied up his clothes, joined his palms towards the Buddha and said:<br><br>"Bhagavan, I have a mantra of Great-Compassionate Heart Dharani and now wish to proclaim it, for comforting and pleasing all living beings; for healing all illness; for living beings to attain additional lifespan; for living beings to gain wealth; for extinguishing all evil karma and weighty sins; for keeping away from hindrance and disasters; for producing merits of all White (pure) Dharmas; for maturing all virtuous-roots; for overcoming all fears; for fulfilling all good wishes. Bhagavan, please be merciful and allow me to speak."<br><br>The Buddha said: "Virtuous man, you have great kindness and great compassion, in order to comfort and please all living beings, you wish to speak the holy mantra, it is the proper time now, please speak it soon, the Tathagata approves and rejoices it, and so do all Buddhas."<br><br>Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva then said to the Buddha: "Bhagavan, I remember that countless billions of kalpas ago, a Buddha, whose name was Thousand Rays King Stillness Thus Come One, appeared in the world. Because of his mercy and mindfulness towards me and all living beings, that Buddha, the World Honored One spoke this Vast, Perfect, Unimpeded, Great Compassionate Heart Dharani, rubbed my crown with his golden hand and said: 'Virtuous man, you should hold this heart-mantra to give great benefit and happiness to all living beings in the future evil age.' At that time I was just at the first Bhumi(stage of Bodhisattva), right after hearing this mantra, I exceeded the eighth Bhumi. At that time, as my heart was joyful, I vowed: 'If I will be able to give benefit and happiness to all living beings in the future, let me have one thousand hands and one thousand eyes immediately.' Instantly after the vow, I got fully one thousand hands and one thousand eyes on my body, then, the grounds of the worlds of the ten directions quaked in six ways, thousands of Buddhas of the ten directions emitted their light to my body and illuminated boundless worlds of the ten directions. From then on, from countless Buddhas and congregations, I have repeatedly heard, accepted and held this Dharani, and the joys were also repeatedly aroused from my heart, and made me greatly enthusiastic. Therefore, I transcended imperceptible births and deaths of countless billions of kalpas. Since then, I have always been reciting and holding this mantra, and have never forgotten it. Because of holding this mantra, I was always born by miraculous creation (nirmana) from lotuses in front of Buddhas, and have never been born from any womb."<br><br>"If there are monks(Bhikshus), nuns(Bhikshunis), laymen(Upasakas), laywomen(Upasikas), pure youth and maidens who wish to recite and hold(keep reciting) this mantra, they should first arouse heir great merciful and compassionate hearts for all living beings, and follow me in making these vows:<br><br>Namo great compassionate Avalokitesvara, May I quickly know all Dharmas;<br><br>Namo great compassionate Avalokitesvara, May I soon obtain the Wisdom Eye;<br><br>Namo great compassionate Avalokitesvara, May I quickly ferry all living beings (to the shore of liberation);<br><br>Namo great compassionate Avalokitesvara, May I soon obtain virtuous skillful means (to enlighten various living beings);<br><br>Namo great compassionate Avalokitesvara, May I quickly board the Prajna Boat;<br><br>Namo great compassionate Avalokitesvara, May I soon transcend the ocean of suffering;<br><br>Namo great compassionate Avalokitesvara, May I quickly achieve precepts, Samadhi and the Way;<br><br>Namo great compassionate Avalokitesvara, May I soon ascend the mountain of Nirvana;<br><br>Namo great compassionate Avalokitesvara, May I quickly dwell in the house of non-action;<br><br>Namo great compassionate Avalokitesvara, May I soon unite with the Dharma-Nature Body.<br><br>If I go towards the mountain of knives, the mountain of knives of itself breaks up;<br><br>If I go towards the boiling oil, the boiling oil of itself dries up;<br><br>If I go towards the hells, the hells of themselves disappear;<br><br>If I go towards the hungry ghosts, the hungry ghosts of themselves become full.<br><br>If I go towards the Asuras, their evil thoughts of themselves are tamed.<br><br>If I go towards the animals, they themselves attain great wisdom."<br><br>"After making these vows, recite my name(Namo Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva) with the deep-felt sincere heart, also recite single-mindedly the name of my teacher -- Amitabha Tathagata(Namo Amitabha), then recite this mantra, 5 times or more in a day, to remove from the body the weighty sins of births and deaths accumulated in hundreds of thousands of billions of kalpas."<br><br>Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva then said to the Buddha: "Bhagavan, if humans or gods recite and hold the phrases of the Great Compassion Dharani, when they are about to die, all the Buddhas of the ten directions will come to receive them with their hands, and they will be reborn in whichever Buddha-World according to their wishes."<br><br>Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva continued to say to the Buddha: "Bhagavan, Should any living being who recites and holds the holy mantra of Great Compassion fall into the three evil paths, I vow not to achieved the Correct-Awakening.<br><br>Should any living being who recites and holds the holy mantra of Great Compassion not be reborn in any Buddha-World, I vow not to achieve the Correct-Awakening.<br><br>Should any living being who recites and holds the holy mantra of Great Compassion not obtain unlimited Samadhis and eloquence, I vow not to achieve the Correct-Awakening.<br><br>Should any living being who recites and holds the holy mantra of Great Compassion not obtain whatever he seeks in his present life, then it cannot be called the Dharani of the Great Compassionate Heart, unless it is used by those who are not virtuous or not completely sincere.<br><br>If a woman dislikes her female body and wishes to become a male, if she recites the phrases of the Great Compassion Dharani but can not change from a female to a male, I vow not to achieve the Correct-Awakening. However, if she arouses even a slightest doubt, her wish will not be satisfied.<br><br>If any living being usurps the drinks, foods, or possessions of Sanghas (group of monks), even though one thousand Buddhas appear in the world, he will not get to repent and reform. Even if he repents, his sins will not be eliminated. But now, by reciting this Great Compassion holy mantra, his sins will be eliminated. If anyone usurps, eats, or uses the drinks, foods, or possessions of Sanghas, he must repent to teachers of the ten directions to eliminate his sins. Now, when he reties this Great Compassion Dharani, the teachers of the ten directions will come to bear witness, and then all his weighty sins and hindrances will be eliminated.<br><br>All evil karma and weighty sins such as the ten evil deeds, the five rebellious sins, slandering people, slandering the Dharmas, breaking the Abstinent-precepts (*), breaking other precepts, destroying stupas (holy towers), wrecking temples, stealing properties of Sanghas, and profaning Brahma (pure) practices, can be completely eliminated (by reciting this Dharani), except this: if one has doubts about this Dharani, then even his small sins and light karma cannot be eliminated, not to mention the weighty sins. Although the weighty sins do not disappear immediately, the reciting can still be the cause of Bodhi in the future."<br><br>(* Abstinent-precepts: The precepts of Tzie/Zhai. To observe these precepts, one must:<br><br>1. eats only vegetarian food;<br>2. takes only one meal before noon each day, eating after noon is prohibited;<br>3. also keeps the five basic precepts: no killing, no stealing, no sexual misconduct, no false speech, no consumption of alcohol.)<br><br>Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva continued to say to the Buddha:<br><br>"People and gods who recite and hold the Great Compassionate Heart Dharani will obtain fifteen kinds of good birth and will not suffer fifteen kinds of bad death. The bad deaths are:<br><br>1. They will not die of starvation or poverty;<br>2. They will not die from having been yoked, imprisoned, caned or otherwise beaten;<br>3.

They will not die of nightmares sent by evil people;<br>13. They will not be killed by deviant spirits or evil ghosts;<br>14. They will not die of evil illnesses that bind the body;<br>15. They will not commit suicide;<br><br>Those who recite and hold the Great Compassion Holy Mantra will not suffer any of these fifteen kinds of bad death and will obtain the following fifteen kinds of good birth:<br><br>1. Their place of birth will always have a good king;<br>2. They will always be born in a good country;<br>3. They will always be born at a good time;<br>4. They will always meet virtuous friends;<br>5. The organs of their body will always be complete;<br>6. Their hearts of Way(Bodhi) will be pure and mature;<br>7. They will not violate the prohibitive precepts;<br>8. All their relatives will be kind and harmonious;<br>9. They will always have the necessary wealth and goods in abundance;<br>10. They will always obtain the respect and help of others;<br>11.

In the place where they are born they will see the Buddha and hear the Dharma;<br>15. They will awaken to the profound meaning of that Proper Dharma which they hear.<br><br>Those who recite and hold the Great Compassionate Heart Dharani will obtain these fifteen kinds of good birth. All gods and people should constantly recite and hold it without laziness."<br><br>After saying that, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva joined his palms and stood upright in front of the congregation, aroused his great compassionate heart for all living beings, smiled and in this way spoke the Sacrosanct Wonderful Phrases of the Vast, Perfect, Unimpeded, Great Compassionate Heart Great Dharani. The Dharani is:<h3 id="z1">The Great Compassion Mantra</h3>Namah Ratnatrayaya.<br>Namo Arya-<br>VaLokitesvaraya.<br>Bodhisattvaya<br>Mahasattvaya.<br>Mahakaruniakaya.<br>Om.<br>Sarva Rabhaye.<br>Sudhanadasya.<br>Namo Skrtva i Mom Arya-<br>Valokitesvara Ramdhava.<br>Namo Narakindi.<br>Herimaha Vadhasame.<br>Sarva Atha.

The heavens rained down precious flowers, which fell in colorful profusion. All the Buddhas of the ten directions were delighted, while the heavenly demons and Exterior-paths practitioners were so frightened that their hair stood on end. Everyone in the congregation achieved different fruitions, including the fruitions of stream-enterer (srota-apanna), once-returner (sakrd-agamin), non-returner (Anagamin), and Arhat; others achieved the first Bhumi(stage of Bodhisattva), the second Bhumi, the third, fourth, fifth ...... up to the tenth Bhumi. Innumerable living beings aroused the Bodhi-Heart (The resolve to save all living beings and help them to achieve the Correct Awakening).<br><br>Then the great Brahma heavenly king arose from his seat, tidied up his clothes, joined his palms respectfully, and said to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva: "How virtuous, Mahasattva! I had attended innumerable Buddha-Congregations and heard myriads of Dharmas and Dharanis, but never before had I heard such Sacrosanct Wonderful Phrases of the Unimpeded Great Compassionate Heart's Great Compassion Dharani. Mahasattva, please tell us the feature and characteristics of this Dharani, all of us will be pleased to know that."<br><br>Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva told the Brahma king: "For the convenience of benefiting all living beings, you have asked me this question. Now you listen carefully, and I will tell you in brief."<br><br>Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva said: "It is the great merciful and compassionate heart, the impartial heart, the motionless heart, the unpolluted and unattached heart, the emptiness-observing heart, the respectful heart, the humble heart, the uncluttered heart, the non-view and non-grasping heart, and the uppermost Bodhi-Heart. You should know that such hearts are the feature and characteristics of this Dharani, you should practice according to them."<br><br>Then the great Brahma king said: "We now know the feature and characteristics of this Dharani, from now on, we will recite and hold it and will never dare to forget or loss it."<br><br>Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva said: "If any virtuous men or virtuous women, who recite and hold this holy Dharani, can arouse the vast Bodhi-Heart that vow to ferry all living beings to the shore of liberation, keep the Abstinent-precepts(*) bodily, arouse the heart of equality towards all living beings, keep reciting this Dharani without interruption, reside in a clean room, wash themselves clean, wear clean clothes, hang up streamers and light up lamps, make offerings with fragrances, flowers, vegetable foods of hundreds of tastes, make their hearts stay still at one place, do not think about others, and recite and hold this Dharani according to the Dharma, then, Sunlight Bodhisattva, Moonlight Bodhisattva and innumerable gods and immortals will come to bear witness and enhance the efficacy of their recitation."<br><br>"At that time, I will illuminate them with a thousand eyes, and protect and support them with a thousand hands. From then on, they will be able to master all worldly literature, and will perfectly understand all Exterior-paths' theories and sorceries, as well as the Veda Scriptures."<br><br>"One who recites and holds this holy mantra can heal all the 84000 kinds of diseases of the world, without exception. He also can command all ghosts and spirits, vanquish heavenly demons, and tame all Exterior-paths practitioners."<br><br>"If one is reading Sutras or practicing Dhyana (Zen) in a mountain or a wild field, and some mountain-spirits, various ghosts, demons, monsters or Devas come to disturb and make him unable to concentrate, recite this mantra once, then all those ghosts and spirits will be tied up."<br><br>"If one can recites this Mantra in accord with Dharma and arouse merciful and compassionate heart towards all living beings, I will then command all virtuous gods, dragon kings, and Vajra Secret-Traces Divinities to always follow and guard him, never leaving his side, guarding him as their own eyes and lives."<br><br>Then Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva said the Gatha:<br><br>"I command the Vajra Secret-Traces Knights: Ucchusma, Kundali, Ankusa, and the eight clans' powerful knight Shankara, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>I command Mahesvaras, Narayana, Kumbhiraba and Kapila, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>I command Pajis, Sahassakkhas, perfect-virtuous chebuds and Kimnaras, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>I command Sajamahoras, Kumbhandas, Katabhutanas, and Banjras, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>I command Bhipagara kings, and morality Vitasaharas, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>I command Brahma king Sambra, the five clans of pure-abode heavens and Yamarajas, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>I command Sakra Devanam indra, the Lord of the thirty-three heavens, Sarasvatis, and Vardhanas, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>I command Dhritarastra king, Haritis, goddess and great strength gods, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>I command Virudhaka king, Virupaksa king and Vaisravana king, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>I command the Golden Peacock King, and the twenty-eight clans of great immortals, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>I command Manibhadra, and Pancika-imperator Phalava, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>I command Nanda, Upandanda, and the Sagara dragon-king Ibhra, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>I command the Asuras, Gandharvas, Karunas, Kimnaras, and Mahoragas, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>I command the gods of water, fire, thunder, lightning, Kumbhanda king and Pisacas, to guard the Mantra-holders constantly;<br><br>"Those virtuous gods, dragon-kings and goddess, each along with 500 retinues of great-strength Yaksas, will always follow and guard the holders of the Great Compassion Holy Mantra. If the Mantra-holder dwells and sleeps alone in an uninhabited mountain or wilderness, those virtuous gods will guard him by turns to eliminate misfortunes. If the Mantra-holder loses his way deep in the mountain, because of reciting this Mantra, the virtuous gods and dragon-kings will transform themselves into virtuous people and tell him the correct way. If the Mantra-holder lacks water or requires fire in a mountain, forest, or wilderness, the dragon-kings will protect him by miraculously creating water and fire for him."<br><br>Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva then said a misfortune-eliminating and refreshingly cool Gatha(verse):<br><br>"When walking in wilderness, mountain or marsh, if encountering tigers, wolves, or other fierce beasts, or snakes, spirits, demons, monsters, ghosts, they will be unable to harm the Mantra-holder when they hear this Mantra;<br><br>When voyaging on river or sea, poisoned dragons, flood dragons and Makaras, Yaksas, Rakshas, fishes, and soft-shelled turtles, will dodge when they hear this Mantra;<br><br>If besieged by battle arrays or robbers, or being robbed by villains, recite the Great Compassion Dharani sincerely, those villains will show mercy and go back;<br><br>If one is imprisoned by government official, jailed, chained and locked, recite the Great Compassion Dharani sincerely, the officer will show mercy and set him free;<br><br>If entered a house of a poisonous insects raising family in a wild way, the family purpose to venom with drinks, foods or medicines, recite the Great Compassion Dharani sincerely, the poison will turn to nectar;<br><br>When a woman is giving birth to a child, evil demons comes to obstruct the birth and causing suffering and oppressive pain, recite the Great Compassion Dharani sincerely, the demons will disperse, leaving a safe and comfortable birth;<br><br>If evil dragons or pestilence ghosts spread poison, people are infected by pyrexia and about to die, recite the Great Compassion Dharani sincerely, diseases will be healed and lives of people will be lengthen;<br><br>If evil dragons or ghosts spread the tumescent diseases, people suffer from carbuncles, sore, abscess, ulcer and bleeding, recite the Great Compassion Dharani sincerely, then spit three times to the abscesses and it will be cured.<br><br>If there are muddled and wicked living beings who aroused immoral minds, causing hatred by sending nightmares, ghosts and curses to you, recite the Great Compassion Dharani sincerely, then the hexes and evil spells will return to its original senders.<br><br>When Dharma is about to disappear, the world is evil, feculent and disordered, poeple's sexual desire are like raging fire, their hearts are deluded and they confuse right and wrong.<br><br>They have adulteries behind their spouses, and think of lust days and nights ceaselessly.<br><br>If they can recite the Great Compassion Dharani sincerely, the fire of sexual desire will quench and the evil minds will extinguish.<br><br>If I glorify the effect and power of this Mantra in detail, even one kalpa is not enough for the glorification."<br><br>Then Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva told the Brahmas: "Recite this Mantra 5 times, use threads of 5 colors to tie knots, then recite the Dharani 21 times, tie 21 knots, wear it on neck. This Mantra has been spoken by previous 9.9 billions Ganges-river-sands Buddhas.<br><br>Those Buddhas spoke this Mantra for the practitioners who practice the six Perfections (Paramita) but have not yet fulfilled them, to make them succeed quickly;<br><br>For those who have not yet aroused Bodhi-Heart, to make them arouse their Bodhi-Heart quickly;<br><br>For Sravakas who have not yet achieved fruitions, to make them achieve fruitions quickly;<br><br>For all gods and supernatural persons in the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds, who have not yet aroused the unsurpassed Bodhi-Heart, to make them arouse the Bodhi-Heart quickly;<br><br>For all living beings who have not yet gained the root of faith in Mahayana, with the mighty holy power of this Dharani, their seeds of Mahayana and Dharma-buds will grow quickly; with the power of my expedients, mercy and compassion, all of their needs will be supplied.<br><br>For those living beings of the three evil paths, who live in the gloomy regions of the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds, when they hear this Mantra, they will all be free from suffering;<br><br>For Bodhisattvas who have not yet achieved the first Bhumi, to make them achieve quickly, and make them achieve even up to the tenth Bhumi, and even up to the Buddhahood, with the thirty-two marks and the eighty minor marks achieved naturally.<br><br>If a Voice-Hearer (Sravaka) once hears this Dharani pass by his ears, if he practices and writes this Dharani, and if he settles down with straightforward heart in accord with Dharma, then he will naturally achieve the four Sramana-fruits even if he does not seek for the fruitions.<br><br>Suppose all the mountains, rivers, cliffs, and oceans in the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds can be boiled; the Sumeru mountains and Cakravada-parvata mountains can be shaken, and grinded to dust, all living beings of that magnitude will arouse the unsurpassed Bodhi-Hearts [by the power of this Dharani].<br><br>If anyone prays for any wish in his present life, he should keep the Abstinent-precepts(*) and keep reciting this Dharani for 21 days, then his wishes will certainly be fulfilled. From the verge of the previous birth-and-death to the verge of the next birth-and-death, all his evil karmas will be cleaned up. In the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds, all the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Brahmas, Sakra Devanam-Indra (heavenly lord), the four guardian gods, divinities, immortals, and dragon-kings, will bear witness."<br><br>(* Abstinent-precepts: The precepts of Tzie/Zhai. To observe these precepts, one must:<br><br>1. eats only vegetarian food;<br><br>2. takes only one meal before noon each day, eating after noon is prohibited;<br><br>3. also keeps the five basic precepts: no killing, no stealing, no sexual misconduct, no false speech, no consumption of alcohol.)<br><br>"If a human or heavenly being, who recites and holds this Dharani, baths in a river or a sea, the nearby living beings wet by his bath-water will have all their weighty sins cleaned and be reborn in pure-lands of other directions. They will be born through miraculous creation from lotuses, and will not undergo birth from wombs, moistures, or eggs. How much more so, for those who recite and hold this Dharani themselves!"<br><br>"If one who recites and holds this Dharani is walking, a wind blows his hair and clothes, then the living beings blown by the wind that previously touched the Mantra-holder will have all their heavy obstructions and evil karmas cleansed, will not continue to suffer from karmas of the three evil paths, and often be born in front of Buddhas.
