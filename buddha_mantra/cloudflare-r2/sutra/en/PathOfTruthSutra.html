<h3 id="z1">Part 1: Yamakavagga / Twin Verses</h3>1. Mind precedes all knowables,<br>mind's their chief, mind-made are they.<br>If with a corrupted mind<br>one should either speak or act<br>dukkha follows caused by that,<br>as does the wheel the ox's hoof.<br><br>2. Mind precedes all knowables,<br>mind's their chief, mind-made are they.<br>If with a clear, and confident mind<br>one should speak and act<br>happiness follows caused by that,<br>as one's shadow ne'er departing.<br><br>3. Who bears within them enmity:<br>"He has abused and beaten me,<br>defeated me and plundered me",<br>hate is not allayed for them.<br><br>4. Who bears within no enmity:<br>"He has abused and beaten me,<br>defeated me and plundered me",<br>hate is quite allayed for them.<br><br>5. Never here by enmity<br>are those with enmity allayed,<br>they are allayed by amity,<br>this is the timeless Truth.<br><br>6. Still others do not understand<br>that we must perish in this world,<br>those who understand this,<br>their quarrels are allayed.<br><br>7. One who beauty contemplates,<br>whose faculties are unrestrained,<br>in food no moderation knows,<br>is languid, who is indolent:<br>that one does Mara overthrow<br>as wind a tree of little strength.<br><br>8. One who foulness contemplates,<br>whose faculties are well-restrained,<br>in food does moderation know,<br>is full of faith, who's diligent:<br>that one no Mara overthrows,<br>as wind does not a rocky mount.<br><br>9. One who wears the stainless robe<br>who's yet not free from stain,<br>without restraint and truthfulness<br>for the stainless robe's unfit.<br><br>10. But one who is self-cleansed of stain,<br>in moral conduct firmly set,<br>having restraint and truthfulness<br>is fit for the stainless robe.<br><br>11. Conceiving the real in unreality<br>while seeing unreal the truly real,<br>roaming fields of thoughts ill-formed:<br>never they at the real arrive.<br><br>12. That which is real they know as real,<br>that unreal, to be unreal;<br>roaming fields of thought well-formed<br>they at the real arrive.<br><br>13. Even as the rain does penetrate<br>a house that's badly thatched,<br>likewise lust does penetrate<br>the mind uncultivated.<br><br>14. As rain does never penetrate<br>a house that is well-thatched,<br>so lust does never penetrate<br>the mind well cultivated.<br><br>15. Here one grieves, one grieves hereafter,<br>in both ways does the evil-doer grieve;<br>one grieves and is afflicted,<br>one's own base kammas seeing.<br><br>16. Here one joys, one joys hereafter,<br>in both ways does the merit-maker joy;<br>one joys and one rejoices,<br>one's own pure kammas seeing.<br><br>17. Here one burns, one burns hereafter,<br>in both ways does the evil-doer burn;<br>evil I've done, remorsefully one burns,<br>and more one burns passed to realms of woe.<br><br>18. Here one's glad, one's glad hereafter,<br>in both ways is the merit-maker glad;<br>"Merit I've made", serenely one is glad,<br>and more one's glad passed to blissful states.<br><br>19. Though many sacred texts he chants<br>the heedless man's no practicer,<br>as cowherd counting other's kine<br>in samanaship he has no share.<br><br>20. Though few of the sacred texts he chants<br>in Dhamma does his practice run,<br>clear of delusion, lust and hate,<br>wisdom perfected, with heart well-freed,<br>not clinging to this or other world,<br>in samanaship he has a share<h3 id="z2">Part 2: Appamadavagga / Heedfulness</h3>21. Heedfulness is the Deathless path,<br>heedlessness, the path to death.<br>Those who are heedful do not die,<br>heedless are like the dead.<br><br>22. The wise then, recognizing this<br>as the distinction of heedfulness,<br>pleased with the spheres of Nobles Ones,<br>in heedfulness rejoice.<br><br>23. They meditate persistently,<br>constantly they firmly strive,<br>the steadfast to Nibbana reach,<br>the Unexcelled Secure from bonds.<br><br>24. Assiduous and mindful,<br>pure kamma making, considerate,<br>restrained, by Dhamma living,<br>and in heedfulness,<br>for one such spreads reknown.<br><br>25. By energy and heedfulness,<br>by taming and by self-control,<br>the one who's wise should make as isle<br>no flood can overwhelm.<br><br>26. Foolish folk of little wit<br>in heedlessness indulge,<br>the one who's wise guards heedfulness<br>kin to the greatest wealth.<br><br>27. Don't indulge in heedlessness!<br>Don't come near to sexual joys!<br>The heedful and contemplative<br>attains abundant bliss.<br><br>28. When one who's wise does drive away<br>heedlessness by heedfulness,<br>having ascended wisdom's tower<br>steadfast, one surveys the fools,<br>griefless, views the grieving folk,<br>as mountaineer does those below.<br><br>29. Among the heedless, heedful,<br>among the sleepy, wide awake.<br>As the swift horse outruns a hack<br>so one of good wisdom wins.<br><br>30. Heedfulness is always praised,<br>heedlessness is ever blamed.<br>By heedfulness did Magha go<br>to lordship of the gods.<br><br>31. The bhikkhu liking heedfulness,<br>seeing fear in heedlessness,<br>advances as a conflagration<br>burning fetters great and small.<br><br>32. The bhikkhu liking heedfulness,<br>seeing fear in heedlessness,<br>never will he fall away,<br>near is he to Nibbana.<h3 id="z3">Part 3: Cittavagga / Mind</h3>33. Mind agitated, wavering,<br>hard to guard and hard to check,<br>one of wisdom renders straight<br>as arrow-maker a shaft.<br><br>34. As fish from watery home<br>is drawn and cast upon the land,<br>even so flounders this mind<br>while Mara's Realm abandoning.<br><br>35. The mind is very hard to check<br>and swift, it falls on what it wants.<br>The training of the mind is good,<br>a mind so tamed brings happiness.<br><br>36. The mind is very hard to see<br>and find, it falls on what it wants.<br>One who's wise should guard the mind,<br>a guarded mind brings happiness.<br><br>37. Drifting far, straying all alone,<br>formless, recumbent in a cave.<br>They will be free from Mara's bonds<br>who do restrain this mind.<br><br>38. One of unsteady mind,<br>who doesn't know True Dhamma,<br>who is of wavering confidence<br>wisdom fails to win.<br><br>39. One of unflooded mind,<br>a mind that is not battered,<br>abandoning evil, merit too,<br>no fear for One Awake.<br><br>40. Having known this urn-like body,<br>made firm this mind as fortress town,<br>with wisdom-weapon one fights Mara<br>while guarding booty, unattached.<br><br>41. Not long alas, and it will lie<br>this body, here upon the earth.<br>Discarded, void of consciousness,<br>useless as a rotten log.<br><br>42. Whatever foe may do to foe,<br>or haters those they hate<br>the ill-directed mind indeed<br>can do one greater harm.<br><br>43. What one's mother, what one's father,<br>whatever other kin may do,<br>the well directed mind indeed<br>can do greater good.<h3 id="z4">Part 4: Pupphavagga / Flowers</h3>44. Who will comprehend this earth,<br>the world of Yama, and the gods?<br>Who will discern the well-taught Dhamma<br>as one who's skilled selects a flower?<br><br>45. One Trained will comprehend this earth,<br>the world of Yama, and the gods,<br>One Trained discerns the well-taught Dhamma<br>as one who's skilled selects a flower.<br><br>46. Having known this froth-like body<br>and awakening to its mirage nature,<br>smashing Mara's flowered shafts<br>unseen beyond the Death-king go.<br><br>47. For one who has a clinging mind<br>and gathers only pleasure-flowers,<br>Death does seize and carry away<br>as great flood a sleeping village.<br><br>48. For one of desires insatiate<br>who gathers only pleasure-flowers,<br>for one who has a clinging mind<br>Death the sovereign overpowers.<br><br>49. Just as a bee in a flower<br>harming neither hue nor scent<br>gathers nectar, flies away,<br>so in towns a Wise One fares.<br><br>50. Not others' opposition<br>nor what they did or failed to do,<br>but in oneself should be sought<br>things done, things left undone.<br><br>51. Just as a gorgeous blossom<br>brilliant but unscented,<br>so fruitless the well-spoken words<br>of one who does not act.<br><br>52. Just as a gorgeous blossom,<br>brilliant and sweet-scented,<br>so fruitful the well-spoken words<br>of one who acts as well.<br><br>53. As from a mass of flowers<br>many a garland may be made,<br>so by one born mortal<br>should many good deeds be done.<br><br>54. The fragrance of flowers drifts with the wind<br>as sandalwood, jasmine of lavender.<br>The fragrance of the virtuous sweeps the wind,<br>all pervasive is virtue of the good.<br><br>55. Sandalwood or lavender,<br>lotus or the jasmine great,<br>of these many fragrances<br>virtue's fragrance is supreme.<br><br>56. Faint is this fragrance<br>of lavender and sandalwood,<br>but fragrance of the virtuous<br>soars sublime amongst the gods.<br><br>57. Of those with perfect virtue<br>who dwell in heedfulness,<br>freed by Final Knowledge:<br>Mara cannot know their path.<br><br>58. As beside the highroad<br>where rubbish in a pit is flung<br>there flourishes the lotus bloom<br>fragrant and the mind's delight.<br><br>59. So among rubbish-beings,<br>common humans blind-become,<br>the Perfect Buddha's pupil<br>outshines with wisdom bright.<h3 id="z5">Part 5: Balavagga / Fools</h3>60. Long is the night for the sleepless,<br>long is the league for the weary one,<br>samsara's way is long for fools<br>who know not the Dhamma True.<br><br>61. If a wayfarer fails to find<br>one better or equal,<br>steadfast he should fare alone<br>for a fool's no fellowship.<br><br>62. "Sons have I, wealth have I",<br>thus the fool is fretful.<br>He himself is not his own,<br>how then are sons, how wealth?<br><br>63. Conceiving so his foolishness<br>the fool is thereby wise,<br>while "fool" is called that fool<br>conceited that he's wise.<br><br>64. Though all through life the fool<br>might wait upon the wise,<br>no more Dhamma can he sense<br>than spoon the taste of soup.<br><br>65. Though briefly one intelligent<br>might wait upon the wise,<br>quickly Dhamma he can sense<br>as tongue the taste of soup.<br><br>66. Fools of feeble wisdom fare<br>enemies to themselves,<br>making evil kamma<br>which is of bitter fruit.<br><br>67. That kamma's not well-made<br>from which there is remorse,<br>of which one senses the result<br>with weeping and a tear-stained face.<br><br>68. But well-made is that kamma<br>which done brings no remorse,<br>of which one senses the result<br>with glad mind and with joy.<br><br>69. When evil kamma's immature<br>the fool thinks it is honeyed,<br>but when the evil has matured<br>then to the fool comes dukkha.<br><br>70. Month after month with blady-grass tip<br>the fool may take his food;<br>he's not worth the slightest bit<br>of one who Dhamma knows.<br><br>71. As milk, is evil kamma done,<br>so slowly does it sour.<br>Smouldering does it follow the fool<br>like fire with ashes covered.<br><br>72. Truly to his detriment<br>skill is born to the fool;<br>ruined is his better nature<br>and scattered are his wits.<br><br>73. For position a fool may wish:<br>among the bhikkhus precedence,<br>in monasteries authority,<br>from other families honours.<br><br>74. Both monks and laymen, let them think<br>"This was done by me,<br>whatever the works, both great and small,<br>let them depend on me".<br>Such the intention of a fool,<br>swollen his greed and conceit.<br><br>75. One is the way to worldly gain,<br>another to Nibbana goes.<br>Clearly comprehending this<br>the bhikkhu, Buddha's follower<br>should wallow not in proffered gifts,<br>surrendering instead to solitude.<h3 id="z6">Part 6: Panditavagga / The Wise</h3>76. Should one a man of wisdom meet<br>who points out faults and gives reproof,<br>who lays a hidden treasure bare,<br>with such a sage should one consort.<br>Consorting so is one enriched<br>and never in decline.<br><br>77. Let him exhort, let him instruct,<br>and check one from abasement.<br>Dear indeed is he to the true,<br>not dear is he to the false.<br><br>78. Don't go around with evil friends,<br>with rogues do not resort.<br>Spend your time with noble friends,<br>and worthy ones consort.<br><br>79. Happy is he who Dhamma drinks<br>with heart that's clear and cool.<br>One so wise e'er delights<br>in Dhamma declared by the Noble.<br><br>80. Irrigators govern waters,<br>fletchers fashion shafts,<br>as joiners shape their timber<br>those who are wise tame themselves.<br><br>81. Just as a mighty boulder<br>stirs not with the wind,<br>so the wise are never moved<br>either by praise or blame.<br><br>82. Even as a fathomless lake,<br>a lake so calm and clear,<br>so dhammas having heard<br>serene the wise become.<br><br>83. Everything the good renounce,<br>the peaceful chatter not of fond delights,<br>and whether touched by pleasure or pain<br>nor joy or woe in the wise is seen.<br><br>84. Neither for one's own, nor for another's sake<br>one should wish for children, wealth and estate,<br>nor success desire by means unjust,<br>thus virtuous, and wise, righteous one would be.<br><br>85. Among folk they are few<br>who go to the Further Shore,<br>most among humanity<br>scurry on this hither shore.<br><br>86. But they who practise Dhamma<br>according to Dhamma well-told,<br>from Death's Domain hard to leave<br>they'll cross to the Further Shore.<br><br>87. Abandoning the Dhammas dark<br>the wise should cultivate the bright,<br>having from home to homeless gone<br>in solitude unsettling.<br><br>88. Let them desire that rare delight<br>renouncing pleasures, owing nought,<br>those wise ones should cleanse themselves<br>from all defilements of the mind.<br><br>89. Those who come to Wakening<br>with mind full-cultivated,<br>delight, no longer clinging,<br>in relinquishing attachment:<br>they, without pollution, radiant,<br>in this world have reached Nibbana.<h3 id="z7">Part 7: Arahantavagga / The saints</h3>90. With journey finished and sorrowless,<br>from everything completely free,<br>for one who has loosened all the ties<br>passion's fever is not found.<br><br>91. Mindful Ones exert themselves,<br>in no abode do they delight,<br>as swans abandoning their lake<br>home after home they leave behind.<br><br>92. For those who don't accumulate,<br>who well reflect upon their food,<br>they have as range the nameless and<br>the void of perfect freedom too.<br>As birds that wing through space,<br>hard to trace their going.<br><br>93. For whom pollutions are destroyed,<br>not attached to any food,<br>he has as range the nameless and<br>the void of perfect freedom too.<br>As birds that wing through space,<br>hard to trace his going.<br><br>94. Whose faculties are pacified<br>as steeds by charioteers well-tamed,<br>with pride abandoned, unpolluted,<br>to even devas this One's dear.<br><br>95. Like earth is one who's well-behaved,<br>secure and not resentful,<br>as city-post, as filth-free lake,<br>no wanderings-on for One Who's Thus.<br><br>96. Peaceful his mind and peaceful<br>his speech and actions too,<br>perfect in knowledge of freedom,<br>One Thus is of utmost peace.<br><br>97. With no beliefs, the Unmade known,<br>with fetters finally severed,<br>with kammas cut and craving shed,<br>attained to humanity's heights.<br><br>98. Whether in town or woods,<br>whether in vale, on hill,<br>wherever dwell the Arahants<br>so pleasing there the earth.<br><br>99. Delightful are the forests<br>where folk do not delight,<br>there the Passionless delight,<br>they're not pleasure-seekers.<h3 id="z8">Part 8: Sahassavagga / Thousands</h3>100. Though a thousand speeches be<br>composed of meaningless lines,<br>better the single meaningful line<br>one hears, then comes to calm.<br><br>101. Though a thousand verses be<br>composed of meaningless lines,<br>better the single line of verse<br>one hears, then comes to calm.<br><br>102. Though a hundred verses chant<br>composed of meaningless lines,<br>better the single Dhamma line<br>one hears, then comes to calm.<br><br>103. Though thousand times a thousand men<br>in battle one may conquer,<br>yet should one conquer just oneself<br>one is the greatest conqueror.<br><br>104. Greater the conquest of oneself<br>than subjugating others,<br>that one who's always well-restrained,<br>that one who's tamed of self .<br><br>105. Neither deva nor minstrel divine,<br>nor Mara together with Brahma,<br>can overthrow the victory<br>of such a one as this.<br><br>106. Month by month for a hundred years<br>a thousand one might sacrifice,<br>but if for only a moment one<br>might honour the self-developed,<br>such honour then were better by far<br>than a century of sacrifice.<br><br>107. One might tend for a hundred years<br>the forest's sacred fire,<br>but if for only a moment one<br>might honour the self-developed,<br>such honour then were better by far<br>than a century of sacrifice.<br><br>108. Whatever one who merit seeks<br>should for a year make sacrifice,<br>all comes not to a quarter part<br>of honouring the Noble.<br><br>109. For one of respectful nature<br>who ever the elders honours,<br>long life and beauty, joy and strength,<br>these qualities increase.<br><br>110. Though one should live a hundred years<br>foolish, uncontrolled,<br>yet better is life for a single day<br>moral and meditative.<br><br>111. Though one should live a hundred years<br>foolish, uncontrolled,<br>yet better is life for a single day<br>wise and meditative.<br><br>112. Though one should live a hundred years<br>lazy, of little effort,<br>yet better is life for a single day<br>strongly making effort.<br><br>113. Though one should live a hundred years<br>not seeing rise and fall,<br>yet better is life for a single day<br>seeing rise and fall.<br><br>114. Though one should live a hundred years<br>not seeing the Deathless State,<br>yet better is life for a single day<br>seeing Deathlessness.<br><br>115. Though one should live a hundred years<br>not seeing Dhamma Supreme,<br>yet better is life for a single day<br>seeing Dhamma Supreme.<h3 id="z9">Part 9: Papavagga / Evil</h3>116. Make haste towards the good<br>and check the mind from evil.<br>The one who's is slow in making merit<br>delights in the mind in evil.<br><br>117. If one should some evil do<br>then do it not again and again.<br>Do not wish for it anew<br>for evil grows to dukkha.<br><br>118. If one should some merit make<br>do it again and again.<br>One should wish for it anew<br>for merit grows to joy.<br><br>119. As long as evil ripens not<br>even the evil one goodness knows,<br>but when the evil ripens<br>then that person evil knows.<br><br>120. As long as goodness ripens not<br>even the good one evil knows,<br>but when the goodness ripens<br>then that person knows the good.<br><br>121. Think lightly not of evil,<br>"It will not come to me",<br>for by the falling of water drops<br>a water jar is filled.<br>The fool with evil fills himself,<br>he soaks up little by little.<br><br>122. Think lightly not of goodness,<br>"It will not come to me",<br>for by the falling of water drops<br>a water jar is filled.<br>The sage with goodness fills himself,<br>he soaks up little by little.<br><br>123. As merchant on a perilous path,<br>great wealth having little guard,<br>as life-loving man with poison<br>so with evil heedful be.<br><br>124. If in the hand's no wound<br>poison one may bear.<br>A woundless one is poisoned not,<br>non-doers have no evil.<br><br>125. Who offends the inoffensive,<br>the innocent and blameless one,<br>upon that fool does evil fall<br>as fine dust flung against the wind.<br><br>126. Some find birth within a womb,<br>evil-doer quicken in hell,<br>good-farers to the heavens go,<br>the Unpolluted wholly cool.<br><br>127. Neither in sky nor surrounding by sea,<br>nor by dwelling in a mountain cave,<br>nowhere is found that place in earth<br>where one's from evil kamma free.<br><br>128. Neither in sky nor surrounding by sea,<br>nor by dwelling in a mountain cave,<br>nowhere is found that place in earth<br>where one's by Death not overcome.<h3 id="z10">Part 10: Dandavagga / Punishment</h3>129. All tremble at force,<br>of death are all afraid.<br>Likening others to oneself<br>kill not nor cause to kill.<br><br>130. All tremble at force,<br>dear is life to all.<br>Likening others to oneself<br>kill not nor cause to kill.<br><br>131. Whoever harms with force<br>those desiring happiness,<br>as seeker after happiness<br>one gains no future joy.<br><br>132. Whoever doesn't harm with force<br>those desiring happiness,<br>as seeker after happiness<br>one then gains future joy.<br><br>133. Speak not harshly to other folk,<br>speaking so, they may retort.<br>Dukkha indeed is quarrelsome speech<br>and force for force may hurt you.<br><br>134. If like a broken gong<br>never you reverberate,<br>quarreling's not part of you,<br>that Nibbana's reached.<br><br>135. As with force the cowherds drive<br>their cattle out to graze,<br>like this decay and death drive out<br>the life from all beings.<br><br>136. When the fool does evil deeds<br>their end he does not know,<br>such kamma burns the one unwise<br>as one who's scorched by fire.<br><br>137. Whoever forces the forceless<br>or offends the inoffensive,<br>speedily comes indeed<br>to one of these ten states:<br><br>138. Sharp pain or deprivation,<br>or injury to the body,<br>or to a serious disease,<br>derangement of the mind;<br><br>139. Troubled by the government,<br>or else false accusation,<br>or by loss of relatives,<br>destruction of one's wealth;<br><br>140. Or one's houses burn<br>on raging conflagration,<br>at the body's end, in hell<br>arises that unwise one.<br><br>141. Not going naked, nor matted hair, nor filth,<br>nor fasting, not sleeping on bare earth,<br>no penance on heels, nor sweat nor grime<br>can purify a mortal still overcome by doubt.<br><br>142. Even though adorned, if living in peace<br>calm, tamed, established in the holy life,<br>for beings all laying force aside:<br>one pure, one peaceful, a bhikkhu is he.<br><br>143. Where in the world is found<br>one restrained by shame,<br>awakened out of sleep<br>as splendid horse with whip?<br><br>144. As splendid horse touched with whip,<br>be ardent, deeply moved,<br>by faith and virtue, effort too,<br>by meditation, Dhamma's search,<br>by knowledge, kindness, mindfulness;<br>abandon dukkha limitless!<br><br>145. Irrigators govern water,<br>fletchers fashion shafts,<br>as joiners shape their timber<br>those of good conduct tame themselves.<h3 id="z11">Part 11: Jaravagga / Old Age</h3>146. Why this laughter, why this joy,<br>when it's ever blazing?<br>Shrouded all about by gloom<br>won't you look for the light?<br><br>147. See this body beautiful<br>a mass of sores, a congeries,<br>much considered but miserable<br>where nothing's stable, nothing persists.<br><br>148. All decrepit is this body,<br>diseases' nest and frail;<br>this foul mass is broken up<br>for life does end in death.<br><br>149. These dove-hued bones<br>scattered in Fall,<br>like long white gourds,<br>what joy in seeing them?<br><br>150. This city's made of bones<br>plastered with flesh and blood,<br>within are stored decay and death,<br>besmearing and conceit.<br><br>151. Even rich royal chariots rot,<br>the body too does rot, decay,<br>but undecaying's Dhamma of the Good;<br>who to the good declare.<br><br>152. Just as the ox grows old<br>so this man of little learning:<br>his fleshiness increases,<br>his wisdom doesn't grow.<br><br>153. Through many of samsara's births<br>I hasten seeking, finding not<br>the builder of this house:<br>pain is birth again, again.<br><br>154. O Builder of this house, you're seen!<br>you shall not build a house again;<br>all you beams have given away,<br>rafters of the ridge decayed,<br>mind to the Unconditioned gone,<br>exhaustion of craving has it reached.<br><br>155. Who have not led the holy life<br>nor riches won while young,<br>they linger on as aged cranes<br>around a fished-out pond.<br><br>156. Who have not led the holy life<br>nor riches won while young,<br>they languish on, worn-out bows,<br>sighing for the past.<h3 id="z12">Part 12: Attavagga / Self</h3>157. If one holds oneself as dear,<br>protected, one protects oneself.<br>One who's wise should be aware<br>through all the watches three.<br><br>158. One should first establish<br>oneself in what is proper.<br>One may then teach others,<br>and wise, one is not blamed.<br><br>159. As one teaches others<br>so should one do oneself.<br>Well-tamed, on may tame others,<br>oneself to tame is hard.<br><br>160. Oneself is refuge of oneself,<br>who else indeed could refuge be?<br>By good training of oneself<br>one gains a refuge hard to gain.<br><br>161. By oneself is evil done,<br>it's born of self and self-produced.<br>Evil grinds the unwise one<br>as diamond does the hardest gem.<br><br>162. He whose conduct's very bad<br>like oak-tree choked with ivy,<br>so he does towards himself<br>what enemies would wish.<br><br>163. Easy is what's bad to do,<br>what's harmful to oneself.<br>But what is good, of benefit,<br>is very hard to do.<br><br>164. Whatever man unwise relies<br>on evil views and so condemns<br>the Teaching of the Arahants,<br>or Noble Ones who Dhamma live,<br>he, as a bamboo fruiting,<br>fruits to self-destruction.<br><br>165. By oneself is evil done,<br>by oneself defiled,<br>by oneself it's left undone,<br>by self alone one purified.<br>Purity, impurity on oneself depend,<br>no one can purify another.<br><br>166. Let none neglect their good<br>for others' good however great.<br>Know well oneself's own good<br>and to that good attend.<h3 id="z13">Part 13: Lokavagga / World</h3>167. Do not follow base desires,<br>nor live with heedlessness,<br>do not follow wrong beliefs<br>to grow in worldly ways.<br><br>168. Rouse yourself, be diligent,<br>in Dhamma faring well.<br>Who dwells in Dhamma's happy<br>in this birth and the next.<br><br>169. Fare in Dhamma coursing well,<br>in evil courses do not fare.<br>Who dwells in Dhamma's happy<br>in this birth and the next.<br><br>170. Just as a bubble may be seen,<br>just as a faint mirage,<br>so should the world be viewed<br>that the Death-king sees one not.<br><br>171. Come, look upon this world<br>like to a rich, royal chariot<br>wherein fools lounge at ease<br>but alert ones linger not.<br><br>172. Whoso was heedless formerly<br>but later lives with heedfulness<br>illuminates all this world<br>as moon when free of clouds.<br><br>173. Who by wholesome kamma<br>covers up the evil done<br>illumines all this world<br>as moon when free from clouds.<br><br>174. This world is blind-become<br>few are here who see within<br>as few the birds break free from net<br>so those who go to heavens.<br><br>175. Swans upon the sun's path fly,<br>the powerful through space,<br>conquering Mara and his host<br>away from the world the wise are led.<br><br>176. For one who falsely speaks,<br>who disregards the Dhamma,<br>who other lives denies:<br>no evil this one will not do.<br><br>177. To heavenly realms the mean don't fare,<br>fools magnanimity ne'er acclaim,<br>but the one of wisdom rejoices at giving<br>and happy will be in future lives.<br><br>178. Than o'er the earth sole sovereignty,<br>than going unto heaven,<br>than lordship over all the worlds:<br>better the Steam-winner's Fruit.<h3 id="z14">Part 14: Buddhavagga / The Buddha</h3>179. That Buddha traceless of infinite range<br>whose victory none may e'er undo,<br>whose vanquished follow to no world,<br>then by which track will you trace him?<br><br>180. That Buddha traceless of infinite range<br>in whom's no entangling craving<br>and no ensnaring not anywhere leading,<br>then by which track will you trace him?<br><br>181. E'er intent on concentration,<br>joyful in peace of letting go,<br>mindful, wise, the perfect Buddhas,<br>to even devas they are dear.<br><br>182. Human birth is hard to gain,<br>hard for mortals is their life,<br>to come to Dhamma True is hard,<br>rare the Buddhas' arising.<br><br>183. Every evil never doing<br>and in wholesomeness increasing<br>and one's heart well-purifying:<br>this is the Buddhas' Teaching.<br><br>184. Patience's the austerity supreme,<br>"Nibbana's supreme" the Buddhas say.<br>One who irks or others harms<br>is not ordained or monk become.<br><br>185. Not reviling, neither harming,<br>well-restrained in Patimokha,<br>knowing reason in one's food,<br>dwelling far in solitude,<br>and striving in the mind sublime:<br>this is the Buddhas' Teaching.<br><br>186. Not by rain of golden coins<br>is found desires' satiety,<br>desires are dukkha, of little joy,<br>thus a wise one understands.<br><br>187. Even with pleasures heavenly<br>that one finds no delight,<br>the perfect Buddha's pupil<br>delights in craving's end.<br><br>188. Many a refuge do they seek<br>on hills, in woods, to sacred trees,<br>to monasteries and shrines they go;<br>folk by fear tormented.<br><br>189. Such refuge isn't secure,<br>such refuge isn't supreme.<br>From all dukkha one's not free<br>unto that refuge gone.<br><br>190. But going for refuge to Buddha,<br>to Dhamma and the Sangha too,<br>one sees with perfect wisdom<br>the tetrad of the Noble Truths:<br><br>191. Dukkha, its causal arising,<br>the overcoming of dukkha,<br>and the Eight-fold Path that's Noble<br>leading to dukkha's allaying.<br><br>192. Such refuge is secure,<br>such refuge is supreme.<br>From all dukkha one is free<br>unto that refuge gone.<br><br>193. Hard to find the pure and noble<br>who isn't born just anywhere,<br>wherever one so wise is born<br>that family thrives happily.<br><br>194. Blessed is the birth of Buddhas,<br>blest True Dhamma's Teaching,<br>blest the Sangha's harmony<br>and blessed is their striving.<br><br>195. Who venerates the venerable<br>Buddhas or their disciples,<br>have overcome the manifold,<br>grief and lamentation left.<br><br>196. They who are "Thus", venerable,<br>cool and free from every fear -<br>no one is able to calculate<br>their merit as "just-so-much".<h3 id="z15">Part 15: Sukhavagga / Happiness</h3>197. We the unhating live<br>happily midst the haters,<br>among the hating humans<br>from hatred dwell we free.<br><br>198. We who are healthy live<br>happily midst the unhealthy,<br>among unhealthy humans<br>from ill-health dwell we free.<br><br>199. We the unfrenzied live<br>happily midst the frenzied,<br>among the frenzied humans<br>from frenzy dwell we free.<br><br>200. We for whom there's nought<br>live indeed so happily,<br>joy-sustained we'll be<br>like resplendent gods.<br><br>201. Victory gives rise to hate,<br>those defeated lie in pain,<br>happily rest the Peaceful<br>surrendering victory-defeat.<br><br>202. There's no fire like lust,<br>no evil like aversion,<br>no dukkha like the aggregates,<br>no higher bliss than Peace.<br><br>203. Hunger is the greatest ill,<br>the greatest dukkha - conditionedness,<br>knowing this reality at it is:<br>Nibbana bliss supreme.<br><br>204. Health's the greatest gain,<br>contentment, best of wealth,<br>trusting's best of kin,<br>Nibbana bliss supreme.<br><br>205. Having drunk of solitude<br>and tasted Peace Sublime,<br>free from sorrow, evil-free,<br>one drinks of Dhamma's joy.<br><br>206. So fair's the sight of Noble Ones,<br>ever good their company,<br>by relating not to fools<br>ever happy one may be.<br><br>207. Who moves among fool's company<br>must truly grieve for long,<br>for ill the company of fools<br>as ever that of foes,<br>but weal's a wise one's company<br>as meeting of one's folk.<br><br>208. Thus go with the steadfast, wise, well-versed,<br>firm of virtue, practice-pure,<br>Ennobled "Such", who's sound, sincere,<br>as moon in wake of the Milky Way.<h3 id="z16">Part 16: Piyavagga / Affection</h3>209. One makes an effort where none's due<br>with nothing done where effort's due,<br>one grasps the dear, gives up the Quest<br>envying those who exert themselves.<br><br>210. Don't consort with dear ones<br>at any time, nor those not dear,<br>'tis dukkha not to see the dear,<br>'tis dukkha seeing those not dear.<br><br>211. Others then do not make dear<br>for hard's the parting from them.<br>For whom there is no dear, undear<br>in them no bonds are found.<br><br>212. From endearment grief is born,<br>from endearment fear,<br>one who is endearment-free<br>has no grief -- how fear?<br><br>213. From affection grief is born,<br>from affection fear,<br>one who is affection-free<br>has no grief -- how fear?<br><br>214. From lustfulness arises grief,<br>from lustfulness springs fear,<br>one wholly free of lustfulness<br>has no grief -- how fear?<br><br>215. From attachment grief is born,<br>from attachment fear,<br>one who is attachment-free<br>has no grief -- how fear?<br><br>216. Out of craving grief is born,<br>out of craving fear,<br>one fully freed of craving<br>has no grief -- how fear?<br><br>217. Perfect in virtue and insight,<br>firm in Dhamma, knower of Truth,<br>dear to the people's such a one<br>who does what should be done.<br><br>218. One with a wish for the Undeclared,<br>with mind so well-pervaded,<br>a mind not bound in pleasures of sense,<br>an "upstream-goer's" called.<br><br>219. One who's long away from home<br>returns in safety from afar,<br>then friends, well-wishers, kinsmen too<br>are overjoyed at his return.<br><br>220. In the same way, with merit done<br>when from this world to another gone<br>those merits then receive one there<br>as relatives a dear one come.<h3 id="z17">Part 17: Kodhavagga / Anger</h3>221. Anger and pride should one forsake,<br>all fetters cast aside,<br>dukkha's none where no desire,<br>no binding to body or mind.<br><br>222. Who checks arising anger<br>as with chariot away,<br>that one I call a charioteer,<br>others merely grip the reins.<br><br>223. Anger conquer by amity,<br>evil conquer with good,<br>by giving conquer miserly,<br>with truth the speaker of falsity.<br><br>224. Speak truth and be not angry,<br>from little give to one who asks,<br>by these conditions three to go<br>unto the presence of the gods.<br><br>225. Those sages inoffensive<br>in body e'er restrained<br>go unto the Deathless State<br>where gone they grieve no more.<br><br>226. For the ever-vigilant<br>who train by day and night<br>upon Nibbana e'er intent<br>pollutions fade away.<br><br>227. An ancient saying, Atula,<br>not only said today --<br>"They are blamed who silent sit,<br>who often speak they too are blamed,<br>and blamed are they of measured speech" --<br>there's none in the world unblamed.<br><br>228. There never was, there'll never be<br>nor now is ever found<br>a person blamed perpetually<br>or one who's wholly praised.<br><br>229. But those who are intelligent<br>praise one of flawless conduct, sage,<br>in wisdom and virtue well-composed,<br>having observed him day by day.<br><br>230. Who's to blame that one so fine<br>as gem from Jambu stream?<br>Even the devas that one praise,<br>by Brahma too is praised.<br><br>231. Rough action one should guard against,<br>be with body well-restrained,<br>bad bodily conduct having shed<br>train oneself in good.<br><br>232. Rough speaking one should guard against,<br>be in speaking well-restrained,<br>bad verbal conduct having shed<br>train oneself in good.<br><br>233. Rough thinking one should guard against,<br>be in thinking well-restrained,<br>bad mental conduct having shed<br>train oneself in good.<br><br>234. Restrained in body are the wise,<br>in speech as well they are restrained,<br>likewise are they restrained in mind,<br>they're perfectly restrained.<h3 id="z18">Part 18: Malavagga / Impurities</h3>235. Now a withered leaf you are<br>and now Death's men draw near,<br>now you stand at the parting gates<br>but waybread you have none.<br><br>236. Make an island of yourself,<br>quickly strive and wise become,<br>freed from stain and passionless<br>to go to the pure Abodes.<br><br>237. Even now the end draws near,<br>to the presence of death you've fared.<br>Along the path's no place for rest<br>and waybread you have none.<br><br>238. Make an island of yourself,<br>quickly strive and wise become,<br>freed from stain and passionless<br>you'll not return, take flesh, decay.<br><br>239. Little by little, time after time,<br>successively then let the sage<br>blow away all blemishes<br>just as a smith with silver.<br><br>240. As rust arisen out of iron<br>itself that iron eats away,<br>so kammas done beyond what's wise<br>lead to a state of woe.<br><br>241. For oral tradition, non-recitation,<br>in household life, non-exertion,<br>the fair of form when slovenly,<br>a sentry's sloth: all blemishes.<br><br>242. In woman, conduct culpable,<br>with givers, avariciousness,<br>all blemishes these evil things<br>in this world or the next.<br><br>243. More basic than these blemishes<br>is ignorance, the worst of all.<br>Abandoning this blemish then,<br>be free of blemish, monks!<br><br>244. Easy the life for a shameless one<br>who bold and forward as a crow,<br>is slanderer and braggart too:<br>this one's completely stained.<br><br>245. But hard the life of a modest one<br>who always seeks for purity,<br>who's cheerful though no braggart,<br>clean-living and discerning.<br><br>246. In the world who life destroys,<br>who words of falsity speaks,<br>who takes what is not freely given<br>or to another's partner goes.<br><br>247. Or has distilled, fermented drinks:<br>Who with abandon follows these<br>extirpates the root of self<br>even here in this very world.<br><br>248. Therefore friend remember this;<br>Hard to restrain are evil acts,<br>don't let greed and wickedness<br>down drag you long in dukkha.<br><br>249. People give as they have faith,<br>as they are bright with joyfulness.<br>Who's troubled over gifts received,<br>the food and drink that others get,<br>neither in daytime nor by night<br>will come to a collected mind.<br><br>250. But who has severed envy's mind,<br>uprooted it, destroyed entire,<br>indeed in daytime and by night<br>will come to a collected mind.<br><br>251. There is no fire like lust,<br>nought seizes like aversion,<br>unequalled is delusion's net,<br>no river's like to craving.<br><br>252. Other's faults are easy to see<br>yet hard it is to see one's own,<br>and so one winnows just like chaff<br>the faults of other people, while<br>hiding away those of one's own<br>as crafty cheat the losing throw.<br><br>253. Who's always seeing other's faults,<br>taking offence, censorious,<br>pollutions spread for such a one<br>who's far from their exhaustion.<br><br>254. In skies above there is no path,<br>no peaceful one's without,<br>in manifoldness do folk delight,<br>Tathagatas are manifold-free.<br><br>255. In skies above there is no path,<br>no peaceful one's without,<br>nothing conditioned ever lasts,<br>no Buddha's ever shaken.<h3 id="z19">Part 19: Dhammatthavagga / Established in Dhamma</h3>256. Whoever judges hastily<br>does Dhamma not uphold,<br>a wise one should investigate<br>truth and untruth both.<br><br>257. Who others guides impartially<br>with carefulness, with Dhamma,<br>that wise one Dhamma guards,<br>a "Dhamma-holder's" called.<br><br>258. Just because articulate<br>one's not thereby wise,<br>hateless, fearless and secure,<br>a "wise one" thus is called.<br><br>259. Just because articulate<br>one's not skilled in Dhamma;<br>but one who's heard even little<br>and Dhamma in the body sees,<br>that one is skilled indeed,<br>not heedless of the Dhamma.<br><br>260. A man is not an Elder<br>though his head be grey,<br>he's just fully ripe in years,<br>"aged-in-vain" he's called.<br><br>261. In whom is truth and Dhamma too,<br>harmlessness, restraint, control,<br>he's steadfast, rid of blemishes,<br>an "Elder" he is called.<br><br>262. Not by eloquence alone<br>or by lovely countenance<br>is a person beautiful<br>if jealous, boastful, mean.<br><br>263. But "beautiful" is called that one<br>in whom these are completely shed,<br>uprooted, utterly destroyed,<br>a wise one purged of hate.<br><br>264. By shaven head no Samana<br>if with deceit, no discipline.<br>Engrossed in greed and selfishness<br>how shall he be a Samana?<br><br>265. All evils altogether he<br>subdues both fine and gross.<br>Having subdued al evil he<br>indeed is called a "Samana".<br><br>266. Though one begs from others<br>by this alone's no bhikkhu.<br>Not just by this a bhikkhu<br>but from all Dhamma doing.<br><br>267. Who both good and evil deeds<br>has gone beyond with holy life,<br>having discerned the world he fares<br>and "Bhikkhu" he is called.<br><br>268. By silence one is not a sage<br>if confused and foolish,<br>but one who's wise, as if with scales<br>weighs, adopts what's good.<br><br>269. Shunning evil utterly<br>one is a sage, by that a sage.<br>Whoever both worlds knows<br>for that one's called a "Sage".<br><br>270. By harming living beings<br>one is not a "Noble" man,<br>by lack of harm to all that live<br>one is called a "Nobel One".<br><br>271. Not by vows and rituals<br>or again by learning much<br>or by meditative calm<br>or by life in solitude.<br><br>272.

Of paths the Eight-fold is the best,<br>of truths the statement Four,<br>the passionless of teachings best,<br>of humankind the Seer.<br><br>274. This is the Path, no other's there<br>for purity of insight,<br>enter then upon this path<br>bemusing Mara utterly.<br><br>275. Entered then upon this Path<br>you'll make an end of dukkha.<br>Freed in knowledge from suffering's stings<br>the Path's proclaimed by me.<br><br>276. Buddhas just proclaim the Path<br>but you're the ones to strive.<br>Contemplatives who tread the Path<br>are freed from Mara's bonds<br><br>276. When with wisdom one discerns<br>transience of conditioned things<br>one wearily from dukkha turns<br>treading the Path to purity.<br><br>277. When with wisdom one discerns<br>the dukkha of conditioned things<br>one wearily from dukkha turns<br>treading the Path to purity.<br><br>278. When with wisdom one discerns<br>all knowables are not a self<br>one wearily from dukkha turns<br>treading the Path to purity.<br><br>279. Though time to strive, not striving,<br>while young and strong yet indeed,<br>weak-minded and irresolute:<br>one finds not wisdom's way.<br><br>280. In speech ever watchful with mind well-restrained<br>never with body do unwholesomeness.<br>So should one purify these three kamma-paths<br>winning to the Way made known by the Seers.<br><br>281. From endeavour wisdom springs,<br>lacking effort wisdom wanes:<br>having known this two-fold path<br>either to progress or decline<br>so should one exhort oneself<br>that wisdom may increase.<br><br>282. The wood cut down but not a tree<br>since it's from wood that fear is born.<br>Having cut wood and woodedness<br>O bhikkhus be without a wood.<br><br>283. As long indeed as woodedness<br>of man to women is not cut<br>so long in bondage is one's mind<br>as milch-calf to the mother cow.<br><br>284. Cut off affection for oneself<br>as a hand a lily in the Fall.<br>Cultivate this peaceful Path,<br>Nibbana by the Buddha taught.<br><br>285. Here shall I spend the Rains,<br>here the Winter, here the Summer.<br>Thus speculates the fool,<br>the danger he knows not.<br><br>286. For one who has a clinging mind<br>and finds delight in babes and herds<br>Death does seize and carry away<br>as great flood a sleeping village.<br><br>287. No sons are there for shelter<br>nor father nor related folk,<br>one by the Death-king seized upon<br>in kin no shelter finds.<br><br>288. Having understood this fact<br>the wise by virtue well-restrained<br>swiftly then should clear the Path<br>leading to Nibbana.<h3 id="z21">Part 21: Pakinnakavagga / Miscellaneous</h3>290. If one should see great happiness<br>in giving up small happiness<br>one wise the lesser would renounce<br>the greater full-discerning.<br><br>291. Who so for self wants happiness<br>by causing others pain,<br>entangled in anger's tangles<br>one's from anger never free.<br><br>292. What should be done is left undone<br>and done is what should not be done,<br>ever the pollutions grow<br>of those ones proud and heedless.<br><br>293. But for who always practice well<br>bodily mindfulness,<br>do never what should not be done,<br>and ever do what should be done<br>for mindful ones, the full-aware,<br>pollutions fade away.<br><br>294. One's mother and father having slain<br>and then two warrior kings,<br>a realm as well its treasurer,<br>one goes immune, a Brahmin True.<br><br>295. One's mother and father having slain<br>and then two learned kings,<br>as well the fifth, a tiger fierce,<br>one goes immune, a Brahmin True.<br><br>296.

Afar the true are manifest<br>like Himalayan range,<br>yet even here the false aren't seen,<br>they're arrows shot by night.<br><br>305.

With one denying truth there goes to hell<br>that one who having done says "I did not".<br>Both of them are making kammas base<br>are equal after death.<br><br>307. Many who wear the yellow robe<br>are unrestrained in evil things,<br>these evil ones by evil deeds,<br>in hell do they arise.<br><br>308. Better to eat a ball of iron<br>glowing as flame of fire<br>than one should eat country's alms<br>immoral and unrestrained.<br><br>309. Four things befall that heedless one<br>sleeping with one who's wed:<br>demerit gained but not good sleep,<br>third is blame while fourth is hell.<br><br>310. Demerit's gained and evil birth,<br>scared man and women -- brief their joy,<br>the king decrees a heavy doom:<br>so none should sleep with one who's wed.<br><br>311. As blady grass when wrongly grasped<br>the hand does lacerate<br>so a mishandled monastic life<br>drags one off to hell.<br><br>312. Whatever of kammas slack,<br>whatever of vows corrupt,<br>a faltering in the holy life<br>never brings ample fruit.<br><br>313. If there's aught that should be done<br>let it be done then steadily,<br>in truth a slack monastic life<br>all the more stirs up the dust.<br><br>314. Better an evil deed not done<br>for misdeed later on torments.<br>Better done is deed that's good,<br>which done, does not torment.<br><br>315. Even as a border town<br>guarded within and without,<br>so should you protect yourselves.<br>Do not let this moment pass<br>for when this moment's gone they grieve<br>sending themselves to hell.<br><br>316. They are ashamed where shame is not<br>but where is shame are not ashamed<br>so by embracing evil views<br>beings go to an evil birth.<br><br>317. They are afraid where fear is not<br>but where is fear are unafraid,<br>so by embracing evil views<br>beings go to an evil birth.<br><br>318. Faults they see where fault is not<br>but where is fault they see it not,<br>so by embracing evil views<br>beings go to an evil birth.<br><br>319. A fault they understand as such,<br>they know as well where fault is not,<br>so by embracing righteous views<br>beings go to a happy rebirth.<h3 id="z23">Part 23: Nagavagga / The Great</h3>320.

The tusker tamed they lead in crowds,<br>the king he mounts the tamed,<br>noblest of humans are the tamed<br>who can endure abuse.<br><br>322. Excellent are mules when tamed<br>and thoroughbred from Sindh,<br>noble the elephant of state,<br>better still one tamed of self.<br><br>323. Surely not on mounts like these<br>one goes the Unfrequented Way<br>as one by self well-tamed<br>is tamed and by the taming goes.<br><br>324. Hard to check the tusker Dhanapala,<br>in rut with temple running pungently,<br>bound, e'en a morsel he'll not eat<br>for he recalls the elephant-forest longingly.<br><br>325. A sluggard stupid, steeped in gluttony,<br>who's sleep-engrossed, who wallows as he lies,<br>like a great porker stuffed, engorged with swill,<br>comes ever and again into a womb.<br><br>326. Formerly this wandering mind wandered<br>where it wished, where whim, where pleasure led.<br>Wisely this day I will restrain it<br>as trainer with hook an elephant in rut.<br><br>327. Do you delight in heedfulness<br>and guard your own mind well!<br>Draw yourselves from the evil way<br>as would elephant sunk in slough.<br><br>328. If for practice one finds a friend<br>prudent, well-behaved and wise,<br>mindful, joyful, live with him<br>all troubles overcoming.<br><br>329. If for practice one finds no friend<br>prudent, well-behaved and wise,<br>like king be leaving conquered land,<br>fare as lone elephant in the wilds.<br><br>330. Better it is to live alone<br>for with a fool's no fellowship,<br>no evil do, be free of care,<br>fare as lone elephant in the wilds.<br><br>331. Blest to have friends when one's in need,<br>blest contentment with whatever is,<br>blessed is merit when life's at an end,<br>abandoning all dukkha is blessedness.<br><br>332. Respect for one's mother brings happiness here<br>as well as respect for one's father.<br>Here happiness comes from respecting the monks<br>and those of virtue excellent.<br><br>333. Blest is virtue till life's end<br>and blest the faith standing firm,<br>blest the attainment of wisdom<br>and blest the non-doing of evils.<h3 id="z24">Part 24: Tanhavagga / Craving</h3>334. As creeping ivy craving grows<br>in one living carelessly.<br>Like this, one leaps from life to life<br>as ape in the forest seeking fruit.<br><br>335. Whomsoever in this world<br>this wretched clinging craving routs<br>for such a one do sorrows grow<br>as grass well-soaked with rain.<br><br>336. But whoever in this world<br>routs wretched craving hard to quell,<br>from such a one do sorrows fall<br>like water drops from lotus leaf.<br><br>337. Prosperity to you, I say,<br>to all assembled here!<br>When needing grass's fragrant root<br>so craving extirpate.<br>Don't let Mara break you again,<br>again as a torrent a reed!<br><br>338. As tree though felled shoots up again<br>it its roots are safe and firm<br>so this dukkha grows again<br>while latent craving's unremoved.<br><br>339. For whom the six and thirty streams<br>so forceful flow to seemings sweet<br>floods of thought that spring from lust<br>sweep off such wrong viewholder.<br><br>340. Everywhere these streams are swirling,<br>up-bursting creepers rooted firm.<br>Seeing the craving-creeper there<br>with wisdom cut its root!<br><br>341. To beings there are pleasures streaming<br>sticky with desire,<br>steeped in comfort, happiness seeking,<br>such ones do come to birth, decay.<br><br>342. Who follow craving are assailed,<br>they tremble as the hare ensnared,<br>held fast by fetter and by bonds<br>so long they come to dukkha again.<br><br>343. Who follow craving are assailed,<br>they tremble as the hare ensnared,<br>so let a bhikkhu craving quell<br>whose aim is passionlessness.<br><br>344. Who without woodness inclines to the wood.<br>free in the wood to woodness returns.<br>Do now regard that person well<br>who free returns to fetter.<br><br>345. Neither of iron nor wood nor hemp<br>is bond so strong, proclaim the wise,<br>as passion's yearn for sons, for wives,<br>for gems and ornaments.<br><br>346. That bond is strong, proclaim the wise,<br>down-dragging, pliable, hard to loose.<br>This passion severed, they wander forth<br>forsaking sensual pleasures.<br><br>347. Ensnared in passion back they fall<br>as spider on a self-spun web.<br>This passion severed, wander the wise<br>forsaking dukkha all.<br><br>348. Let go before, let go the after,<br>let go the middle, beyond the becoming.<br>With mind released in every way<br>you'll come no more to birth, decay.<br><br>349. For one who's crushed by thinking much<br>excessive lust from beauty's sight,<br>for that one craving grows the more,<br>that one makes strong the bonds.<br><br>350. But who delights in subduing evil thoughts,<br>meditates on the impurities with mindfulness,<br>that one indeed will make an End,<br>and will sever Mara's bonds.<br><br>351. One who's fearless, reached the End,<br>of craving and of blemish free,<br>who has becoming's thorn plucked out,<br>has this, a final body.<br><br>352. One of clinging-craving free,<br>who's skilled in way of chanting,<br>knowing the wording-sequence,<br>of what precedes and follows,<br>possessed of final body,<br>one greatly wise, "Great Person"'s called.<br><br>353. Beyond all beings, wise to all,<br>unsoiled by dhammas all am I,<br>left all and freed by craving's end,<br>by self I've known, whom teacher call?<br><br>354. Gift of Dhamma surpasses all gifts,<br>the Dhamma, its taste all other tastes beats,<br>delight in the Dhamma bests other delights,<br>destruction of craving conquers all ill.<br><br>355. Riches ruin a foolish one<br>but not one seeking the Further Shore,<br>craving for wealth a foolish one<br>is ruined as if ruining others.<br><br>356. Weeds are a fault of fields,<br>lust's a human fault,<br>thus offerings to the lustless<br>bear abundant fruit.<br><br>357. Weeds are a fault of fields,<br>hate's a human fault,<br>hence offerings to the hateless<br>bear abundant fruit.<br><br>358. Weed are the fault of fields,<br>delusion, human's faults,<br>so gifts to the undeluded<br>bear abundant fruit.<br><br>359. Weed are the fault of fields,<br>desire, human's faults,<br>so gifts to the desireless<br>bear abundant fruit.<h3 id="z25">Part 25: Bhikkhuvagga / The Monk</h3>360. Right is restraint in the eye,<br>restraint in the ear is right,<br>right is restraint in the nose,<br>restraint in the tongue is right.<br><br>361. Right is restraint in the body,<br>restraint in speech is right,<br>right is restraint in the mind,<br>everywhere restraint is right.<br>The bhikkhu everywhere restrained<br>is from all dukkha free.<br><br>362. With hands controlled and feet controlled,<br>in speech as well as head controlled,<br>delighting in inward collectedness<br>alone, content, a bhikkhu's called.<br><br>363. Whatever bhikkhu tongue-controlled<br>speaks wisely and who is not proud,<br>who theory and practice can expound,<br>sweet as honey is his speech.<br><br>364. The bhikkhu who in Dhamma dwells,<br>in Dhamma delighting and pondering,<br>remembering the Dhamma -- he<br>does not decline from Dhamma True.<br><br>365. He should not disdain his gains<br>nor live of others envious,<br>the bhikkhu who is envious<br>does not attain collectedness.<br><br>366. Disdaining not his gains,<br>though little he receives,<br>pure of life and keen<br>that bhikkhu devas praise.<br><br>367. For whom there is no making "mine"<br>towards all name and form,<br>who does not grieve for what is not,<br>he's truly "bhikkhu" called.<br><br>368. The bhikkhu in kindness abiding,<br>bright in the Buddha's Teaching<br>can come to the Place of Peace,<br>the bliss of conditionedness ceased.<br><br>369. O bhikkhu bail this boat,<br>when emptied it will swiftly go.<br>Having severed lust and hate<br>thus to Nibbana you'll go.<br><br>370. Five cut off and five forsake,<br>a further five then cultivate,<br>a bhikkhu from five fetter free<br>is called a "Forder of the flood".<br><br>371. Meditate bhikkhu! Don't be heedless!<br>Don't let pleasures whirl the mind!<br>Heedless, do not gulp a glob of iron!<br>Bewail not when burning, "This is dukkha"!<br><br>372. No concentration wisdom lacks,<br>no wisdom concentration lacks,<br>in whom are both these qualities<br>near to Nibbana is that one.<br><br>373. The bhikkhu gone to a lonely place<br>who is of peaceful heart<br>in-sees Dhamma rightly,<br>knows all-surpassing joy.<br><br>374. Whenever one reflects<br>on aggregates' arise and fall<br>one rapture gains and joy.<br>'Tis Deathless for Those-who-know.<br><br>375. Here's indeed the starting point<br>for the bhikkhu who is wise,<br>sense-controlled, contented too,<br>restrained to limit freedom ways,<br>in company of noble friends<br>who're pure of life and keen.<br><br>376. One should be hospitable<br>and skilled in good behaviour,<br>thereby greatly joyful<br>come to dukkha's end.<br><br>377. Just as the jasmine sheds<br>its shrivelled flowers all,<br>O bhikkhus so should you<br>lust, aversion shed.<br><br>378. That bhikkhu calmed of body, speech,<br>calmed and well-composed of mind,<br>who world-enjoyments has renounced,<br>"one calmed" indeed is truly called.<br><br>379. By yourself exhort yourself!<br>By yourself restrain yourself!<br>So mindful and self-guarded too,<br>happily, bhikkhu, will you live.<br><br>380. Oneself is refuge of oneself<br>and one is a haven for oneself,<br>therefore one should check oneself<br>as a merchant with a splendid horse.<br><br>381. The bhikkhu full of joy and faith,<br>bright in the Buddha's Teaching<br>can come to the Place of Peace,<br>the bliss of conditionedness ceased.<br><br>382. Surely that youthful bhikkhu who<br>strives in the Buddha's Teaching<br>illuminates all this world<br>as moon when free from clouds.<h3 id="z26">Part 26: Brahmanavagga / The Brahmana</h3>383. O brahmin, strive and cleave the stream,<br>desires of sense discard,<br>knowing conditioned things decay<br>be Knower-of-the-Uncreated.<br><br>384. When by the twofold Dhamma<br>a Brahmin's gone beyond<br>all the bonds of One-who-Knows<br>have wholly disappeared.<br><br>385.

By barring-out badness a "brahmin" one's called<br>and one is a monk by conduct serene,<br>banishing blemishes out of oneself<br>therefore one's known as "one who has left home".<br><br>389. One should not a brahmin beat<br>nor for that should He react.<br>Shame! Who would a Brahmin beat,<br>more shame for any should they react.<br><br>390.
