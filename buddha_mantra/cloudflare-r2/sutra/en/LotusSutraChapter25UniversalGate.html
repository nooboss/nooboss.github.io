At this time, Aksayamati Bodhisattva rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, joined his palms and asked the Buddha, “Bhagavan (World-Honoured) ! Why is Avalokitesvara Bodhisatva called the Hearer of all sounds?”<br><br>

Buddha discoursed to Aksayamati Bodhisattva, “Good man, Countless individuals are suffering from pain and torment. If they have heard of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, and single-mindedly call upon him. Avalokitesvara will heed their cry. They shall all gain deliverance.<br><br>

For those who hold on to Avalokitesvara’s name, in the midst of fire, they will not be burnt. It is all because of Avalokitesvara’s miraculous power.<br><br>

Even when one is carried off by a strong current, calling upon his name, one will find a shallow shore.<br><br>

If a trillion individuals, in the quest for gold, silver, crystal, lapis, agate, coral, opal and pearls, venture into the open sea, a storm pushes them to the land of demons. If one among them calls upon Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, they shall all be saved. It is for this reason, Avalokitesvara is called the Hearer of all Sounds.<br><br>

When one is about to be killed, and calls upon Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, the foe’s weapon shall be shattered to pieces. One shall be spared.<br><br>

If demons from the whole universe gather and wish to harm one, by the name of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva alone, demons cannot even give and evil eye, how much less inflict actual harm?<br><br>

If one, whether guilty or not, is jailed and in shackles, and calls upon Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, the shackles shall be broken. One is liberated and free.<br><br>

If bandits from the entire universe go after a convoy carrying many valuables, one merchant amongst them says: “Good men! Have no fear, you should pray to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. This Bodhisattva can confer courage upon you. Those who call upon his name shall be saved from the bandits.” Hearing this, the merchants all chant, “Let’s take refuge in Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva!” By this act, they are all saved. <br><br>

Aksayamati! Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva is indeed powerful!<br><br>If one who is addicted to sexual desires prays sincerely to Avalokitesvara Bodhisatva, one will be detached from desire.<br><br>If one who is full of hatred prays sincerely to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, one will be detached from anger.<br><br>If one who is ignorant prays sincerely to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, one is liberated from ignorance.<br><br>Aksayamati! Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, is very powerful and benevolent. Therefore, all beings should be mindful of him.<br><br>If a woman wish to have a son, prostrates and makes offerings to Avalokitesvara Bodhisatva, a son of excellence and wisdom shall be born. If she wishes to have a daughter, a daughter of grace and beauty shall be born.<br><br>

Aksayamati! Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva possesses all these powers.<br><br>If an individual will prostrate to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva respectfully, one will have acquired endless merit. For this reason, everyone should hold on to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva’s name.<br><br>

Aksayamati! If someone holds on to the names of Bodhisattvas numbered equal to the grains in sixty-two trillion Ganges Rivers, offers them food, clothing, lodging, medicine as long as they live, what do you think, does this good man or woman acquire much merit?<br><br>Aksayamati replied, “Very much indeed, Bhagavan.”<br><br>

The Buddha said, “If another person holds on to Avalokitesvara Bodhisatva’s name, making prostrations and offerings for just a moment, the merit between these two people are identical. For a hundred thousand million trillion kalpa, the merit will still not be exhausted.<br><br>

Aksayamati! Holding on to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva’s name has the reward of boundless and countless merit.<br><br>

Aksayamati Bodhisattva further asked the Buddha, “Bhagavan! How does Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva venture about the Saha world? How does he preach Dharma to all? As for his skillful means, what is the manner of it?<br><br>

The Buddha discoursed to Aksayamati Bodhisattva, “Good men, if there are beings who will be illuminated by Buddhas, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva will preach Dharma to them in the form of a Buddha. If one is to be illuminated by Pratyeka Buddhas, he will preach in the form of a Pratyeka Buddha. If one is to be illuminated by Sravakas, he will preach in the form of a Sravaka.<br><br>

If one is illuminated by a Brahma god, he will preach in the form of a Brahma god.<br><br>If one If one is to be illuminated by a Sakra god, he will preach in the form of a Sakra god.<br><br>If one is to be illuminated by a Nirmanarati god, he will preach in the form of a Nirmanarati god. <br><br>If one is to be illuminated by a Patanirmitavasavartin god, he wil preach in the form of a Patanirmitavasavartin god.<br><br>If one is to be illuminated by a Caturmahvajakayikadeva, he will preach in the appearance of a Caturmahvajakayikadeva god.<br><br>If one is to be illuminated by a Virsravana, he will preach in the form of a Virsravana.<br><br>If one is to be illuminated by a king, he will preach in the form of a king.<br><br>If one is to be illuminated by an elder, he will preach in the form of an elder.<br><br>If one is to be illuminated by a lay person, he will preach in the form of a lay person.<br><br>If one is to be illuminated by an official, he will preach in the form of an official.<br><br>If one is illuminated by a Brahma priest, he will preach in the form of a Brahma priest.<br><br>If one is to be illuminated by a bhikshu, bhikshuni, upasaka, upasika, hw will preach in the form of a bhikshu, bhikshuni, upasaka, upasika.<br><br>If one is to be illuminated by the wife of an elder, lay person, official, or Brahma priest, he will preach in the form of a woman.<br><br>If one is to be illuminated by a boy or girl, he will preach in the form of a boy or girl.<br><br>If one is to be illuminated by Deva, Naga, Yaksa, Gandharva, Asura, Garuda, Kinnara, Mahoraga, human and spirits, he will preach in the appropriate forms.<br><br>If one is to be illuminated by a Vajrapani, he will preach in the form of a Vajrapani.<br><br>

Aksayamati! Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva has achieved such merit and virtues. In different forms, he ventures across the lands, bringing emancipation to all. For this reason, you all should single-mindedly make offerings to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.<br><br>

In the midst of danger, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva can confer on you courage and security. Therefore, in this Saha World, he is also known as the “Giver of Courage.”<br><br>

Akasayamati Bodhisattva proclaimed to the Buddha, “Bhagavan! I should now make offerings to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.” He then took off a necklace of gems and garlands, valued at a million ounces of gold, and presented it as a gift, saying: “Sir! Please accept this Dharma offering of gems and garlands.”<br><br>

At first, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva declined the gift. Aksayamati Bodhisattva insisted and said to Avalkitesvara Bodhisattva, “Sir! For our sake, please do accept this garland.”<br><br>

At this point, the Buddha said to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, “For the sake od Aksayamati Bodhisattva, the disciples, Devas, Negas, Yaksas, Gandharvas, Asuras, Garudas, Kinnaras, Mahoragas, Humans and Spirits, you should accept the garland.” <br><br>

Avalokitesvara Bodhisatva, for the sake of Aksayamati Bodhisattva, the disciples, Devas, Negas, Yaksas, Gandharvas, Asuras, Garudas, Kinnaras, Mahoragas, Humans and Spirits, accepted the garland. He then divided it into two. One portion is offered to Sakyamuni Buddha. The other is offered to the stupa of the Prabhutaratna Buddha.<br><br>

Aksayamati Bodhisattva! Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva has such unobstructed magical power and ventures about in the Saha World. At that time, Aksayamati Bodhisattva asked again in verse:<br><br>

Bhagavan, the one endowed with all the holy marks<br>Might I ask thou once more<br>Why is this son of the Buddha<br>Called the Hearer of all Sounds?<br>The holder of all holy marks<br>Replied in rhymes to Aksayamati:<br>Watch carefully<br>Avalokitesvara’s deeds<br>He responds as well in all situations<br>His vows are as deep as an ocean<br>Unimaginable through the kalpas<br>He has served trillions of Buddhas<br>And pledged profound and pious vows<br>I will make it brief<br>Hearing his name or seeing his image<br>Even for a short time is rewarding<br>It can extinguish all sufferings.<br>If someone is malicious<br>Pushing one into a fire pit<br>And one is mindful of Avalokitesvara’s power<br>The fire pit can turn into a pond<br>If someone is drifting in the ocean<br>And surrounded by dragons, sharks and demons<br>Mindful of Avalokitesvara’s power<br>One will not be drown.<br>If one is being pushed off the peak of Sumeru<br>And one is mindful of Avalokitesvara’s power<br>One can float in the sky like the sun<br>If chased by an enemy<br>And cast off a diamond peak<br>One is mindful of Avalokitesvara’s power<br>He will not even be scratched.<br>If surrounded by enemies with knives<br>And about to be attacked<br>One is mindful of Avalokitesvara’s power<br>They will have tender hearts<br>If persecuted by the courtis imminent<br>One is just mindful of Avalokitesvara’s power<br>The knives will be shattered to pieces<br>If jailed an in chains<br>Both arms and legs shackled<br>One is mindful of Avalokitesvara’s power<br>One will gain release<br>If cursed or poisoned<br>The one in danger<br>Is mindful of Avalokitesvara’s power<br>The spell shall be sent back.<br>If encountered by demons<br>Dragons or ghosts<br>One is just mindful of Avalokitesvara’s power<br>They will not dare to do any harm<br>If circled by wild beasts<br>Threatened by sharp claws and teeth<br>One is mindful of Avalokitesvara’s power<br>They will run off and disappear.<br>There may be snakes or scorpions<br>With poisonous venom<br>One is just mindful of Avalokitesvara’s power<br>And they will scatter by themselves.<br>If the heaven roars with thunder<br>Hail and rain pours down<br>One is mindful of Avalokitesvara’s power<br>The sky turns clear.<br>If beings are all in confinement<br>And pressed upon by countless pain<br>Avalokitesvara has great wisdom<br>To emancipate all earthly sufferings<br>Full endowed with magical powers<br>He knows all expedient means<br>In all lands and in all dimensions<br>He manifests everywhere<br>In all evil realms:<br>Such as hell, ghost and animal<br>Facing pain of birth, aging, sickness and death<br>He can eliminate them all.<br>He is truthful and pious<br>He possesses great wisdom<br>With kindness and compassion<br>May we forever pay homage to him<br>He is shining with spotless purity<br>Like the sun banishes darkness<br>He can subdue disasters of wind and fire<br>And illuminate the entire world.<br>His compassion and precepts roar like thunder<br>And his kindness embraces like clouds<br>Quenching the world’s thirst with holy water<br>And eliminating all distress and sufferings.<br>In trial or in battle<br>Be mindful of Avalokitesvara’s power<br>The foes shall withdraw.<br>The wonderful voice of Avalokitesvara<br>Rolling like the Braha’s song and tide<br>Surpasses the best of earthly sounds,<br>Thus we should always be mindful of him<br>Be mindful without doubt<br>Avalokitesvara is a pious saint<br>In the midst of pain, distress, death and danger<br>He can be relied upon.<br>He is fully endowed with virtues<br>And kindly looks upon all beings<br>He has accumulated merits deeper than the ocean<br>Thus you should prostrate to him.<br><br>

At this point, Dharanimdhara Bodhisattva rose from his seat, and proclaimed to the Buddha, “Bhagavan! Any beings who have heard of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva’s wonderful deeds, the manifestation of this universal gateway, his magical power, these beings have acquired enormous merit.”<br><br>

When the Buddha discoursed this chapter of the Universal Gateway, eighty-four thousand beings in the assembly pledged the unique vow of Anuttara SamyakSambodhi (Perfect Universal Enlightenment).
