Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. So, it is with feeling, perception, mental formation, and consciousness.<br><br>Sāriputra, all dharmas are empty in character; neither arising nor ceasing, neither impure nor pure, neither increasing nor decreasing. Therefore, in emptiness, there is no form; there is no feeling, perception, mental formation, or consciousness; no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind; no form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or dharma; no realm of vision, and so forth, up to no realm of mindconsciousness; no ignorance or ending of ignorance, and so forth, up to no aging and death or ending of aging and death.<br><br>There is no suffering, no cause, no extinction, no path.<br>There is no wisdom and no attainment.<br>There is nothing to be attained. By way of Prajñā Pāramitā, the Bodhisattva’s mind is free from hindrances; with no hindrance, there is no fear; freed from all distortions and delusions, ultimate Nirvana is reached.<br><br>By way of Prajñā Pāramitā, all Buddhas of the past, present, and future attain Anuttarā Samyak-sambodhi.<br><br>Therefore, Prajñā Pāramitā is the great powerful mantra, the great enlightening mantra, the supreme and peerless mantra. It can remove all sufferings. This is the truth beyond all doubts. <br><br>And the Praiñā Pāramitā mantra is spoken thus:<br><br>Gate Gate Paragate Parasamgate Bodhi Svaha.
